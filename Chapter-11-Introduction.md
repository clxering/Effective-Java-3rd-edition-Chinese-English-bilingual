## Chapter 11. Concurrency（并发）

### Chapter 11 Introduction（章节介绍）

THREADS allow multiple activities to proceed concurrently. Concurrent programming is harder than single-threaded programming, because more things can go wrong, and failures can be hard to reproduce. You can’t avoid concurrency. It is inherent in the platform and a requirement if you are to obtain good performance from multicore processors, which are now ubiquitous. This chapter contains advice to help you write clear, correct, well-documented concurrent programs.
